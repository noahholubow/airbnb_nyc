The goal of this project is to predict the expected nightly price of an Airbnb rental in New York City. Airbnb is a vacation rental marketplace based in San Francisco, California. I am primarily investigating the relationship between nightly price and a host of other factors, enumerated below. The dataset is confined to New York City and its five boroughs: Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn, and The Bronx in the year 2019.
There are 48,895 observations. The dataset provides a good mix of categorical and numerical data. Columns of interest include NYC borough, room type, minimum number of nights, number of reviews, reviews per month, host listings, yearly availability. These are the regressors. The outcome variable is then, of course, the nightly rate.
